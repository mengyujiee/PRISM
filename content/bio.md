I am a PhD student in Genomics at the School of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), participating in the [BGI-UCAS Joint Program](https://portal-oss.zhiye.com/101919/resource/228fe48b-6c1a-4920-a8f3-d226b2c7e5e4.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Hao Zheng](https://www.zhenghaolab.org/).

Prior to this, I obtained my Master of Engineering degree from China Agricultural University in 2023 and my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Northwest A&F University in 2020.

My current research focuses on investigating gut microbial diversity and host adaptation, using the honeybee as a model organism.
